[[MicroProfile_Metrics_SmallRye]]
= MicroProfile Metrics Subsystem Configuration

Support for https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-metrics[Eclipse MicroProfile Metrics] is provided by
 the _microprofile-metrics-smallrye_ subsystem.

[[required-extension]]
== Required Extension

This extension is included in all the standalone configurations included in the
WildFly distribution.

You can also add the extension to a configuration without it either by adding
an `<extension module="org.wildfly.extension.microprofile.metrics-smallrye"/>`
element to the xml or by using the following CLI operation:

[source,ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /]/extension=org.wildfly.extension.microprofile.metrics-smallrye:add
----

== Management Model

The `/subsystem=microprofile-metrics-smallrye` resource defines two attributes:

* `security-enabled` - a boolean to indicate whether authentication is required to access the HTTP metrics endpoint (described below). By default, it is `true`. The
standalone configurations explicitly sets it to `false` to accept unauthenticated access to the HTTP endpoints.
* `exposed-subsystems` - a list of strings corresponding to the names of subsystems that exposes their metrics in the HTTP metrics endpoints.
  By default, it is not defined (there will be no metrics exposed by subsystem. The special wildcard `*` can be used to expose metrics from _all_ subsystems. The standalone
  configuration sets this attribute to `*`.

== HTTP Endpoint

The Metric HTTP endpoint is accessible on WildFly HTTP management interface http://localhost:9990/metrics[http://localhost:9990/metrics].

Secured access to the HTTP endpoint is controlled by the `security-enabled` attribute of the `/subsystem=microprofile-metrics-smallrye` resource.
If it is set to `true`, the HTTP client must be authenticated.

If the application server is healthy, it will return a `200 OK` response:

---
$ curl -v http://localhost:9990/metrics
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
# HELP base:classloader_total_loaded_class_count Displays the total number of classes that have been loaded since the Java virtual machine has started execution
.
# TYPE base:classloader_total_loaded_class_count counter
base:classloader_total_loaded_class_count 10822.0
...
---

If security has been enabled, the HTTP client must pass the credentials corresponding to a management user
created by the `add-user` script. For example:

---
$ curl -v --digest -u myadminuser:myadminpassword http://localhost:9990/metrics
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
# HELP base:classloader_total_loaded_class_count Displays the total number of classes that have been loaded since the Java virtual machine has started execution
.
# TYPE base:classloader_total_loaded_class_count counter
base:classloader_total_loaded_class_count 10822.0
...
---

If the authentication fails, the  server will reply with a `401 NOT AUTHORIZED` response.

== Exposed Metrics

The HTTP endpoint exposes the following metrics:

* Base metrics - Required metrics specified in the MicroProfile 1.1 specification are exposed in the `base`  scope.
* Vendor metrics - Metrics from WildFly subsystems are exposed in the `vendor` scope
* Application metrics - Metrics from the application and from the deployment's subsystems are exposed in the `application` scope.

== Component Reference

The Eclipse MicroProfile Health is implemented by the SmallRye Health project.
